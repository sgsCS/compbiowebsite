Python and R are both simple, effective and well-developed programming languages that can perform an infinitie amount of tasks ranging from web development to data mining and analysis. Any task can be done by using exclusively python or R. But like Hannah Montana would say, you put them all together and you get the best of both worlds. Using R and Python together can end up working really well. 


## Python
Python as a language for data science is impressive but unlike R, there are many packages that you can choose from like scikit and such and it can become difficult to choose what to use for whatever analysis you need to do. 

```{python}

my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

# function that ocunts 3mers 
def count_mers(string):
    kmers = {}
    subs = [string[s:s+3] for s in range(len(string)) if len(string[s:s+3]) > 2]
    for seq in subs:
        if seq in kmers:
            kmers[seq] += 1
        else:
            kmers[seq] = 1
    print(kmers)

print("3 count k-mers in seq 1 :: ") 
count_mers(my_seq1)
print("3 count k-mers in seq 2 :: ")
count_mers(my_seq2)

```

Here we use python to determine the number of k-mers from a read of DNA. A k-mer is all the possible sequences of length k in a DNA read. This example finds all the '3-mers' in 2 DNA sequences and prints them out with the count for each 3-mer.

## R
Compared to python, R was developed for data science. So many of the implicit packages are made for doing different analyses on data as well as visualization of that data. One of the best external packages for data visualization is ggplot2 which cam create superb visualizations of data.

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
msleep1<-msleep[!is.na(msleep$vore),]
msleep1$size <- ifelse(msleep1$bodywt<median(msleep1$bodywt),"Small","Large")
 
ggplot(msleep1, aes(order))+
geom_bar(aes(fill=order))+
coord_flip()+
theme(legend.position="none")

```

Here we take the msleep data which documents sleep habits of different mammals and we can display this data colorfully using ggplot. 

## What they can do together
Together python and R can do magical things. Using reticulate, an R package, python and R chuncks can communicte together. 

```{R}
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
py_available(TRUE)
autos = cars
```

```{python}
import pandas
autos_py = r.autos
autos_py['time'] = autos_py['dist']/autos_py['speed']
```

```{R}
plot(py$autos_py)

``` 
Here we use an R dataset, cars, and use it in python to do a simple calcuation. After saving it in a variable it can be accessed by another R chunk and a plot can be made. This is of course a simple showing of the capabilites of using these 2 languages together.


## Final Thoughts

I personally have spent a lot more time with python than I have with R so I am usually biased in that direction. However, both programs have their specialties and in conjuction can be used to do fantastic things.
