# About me

My name is Siddarth Satish and I am a computational biology major at the University of Texas at Austin. I began my college career as a pre-med student interested in becoming a physician but I then became fasccinated in data science and decided to pursue a path in with more focus in that area. I am currently pursuing a certificate in elements of computing which supplments my degree with programming knowledge. I have worked with the breseq lab at UT in developing a program that allows for visualization of mutations in bacterial genomes. I hope to further my career working in the software field.
